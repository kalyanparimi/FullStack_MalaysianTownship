# FullStack_MalaysianTownship
A Real-Time project which encompasses the development of frontend and backend for a residential society, to manage accounts and payments of hundreds of residents residing. Includes development of front-end(HTML,JS,CSS) and back-end(SQL,PL-SQL).  The ideation behind the execution of this idea was to establish a distributed ledger-based system for maintaining society cash inflow and outflow which was previously monitored using a notebook ledger. Our task was to create a standalone application that would actually maintain a database for all the previous years so that a PL/SQL report can be run to directly execute a transaction that returns the funds expenditure in the past few years as compared to the present year.
